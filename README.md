Overview
Welcome to the Alash CNC Machine Software repository. This software was developed as part of a diploma project to control and manage a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine. The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for CNC machine operation, allowing users to perform precise and automated manufacturing tasks.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface designed for both novice and experienced users.
G-Code Interpretation: Efficient parsing and execution of G-code instructions for precise machine operations.
Real-Time Monitoring: Live feedback and monitoring of machine status, including position, speed, and operational parameters.
Customizable Settings: Adjustable machine parameters and settings to tailor operations to specific requirements.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error detection and handling mechanisms to ensure smooth and safe machine operations.
Simulation Mode: Ability to simulate machining operations before actual execution to validate G-code and operational parameters.
